This is a Major Project made using PHP and MySQL, if you want to try it out, just download all the file as it is and using XAMPP localhost, you can view it easily, as for the database requirements, a dummy SQL data is also provided in a form of .sql file, use that to import a database on phpmyadmin, it should be enought to show the main functions of the web application
Have fun ! Feel free to give suggestions for future enhancements !
